* Click on the gear icon and then click Settings
* Click on "Import & Export" in the sidebar
* Click on the Export button, this will save a zip file in your computers Download folder
* Open your Downloads folder and extract the zip file
* Go to the [calendar website](https://calendar.google.com) and log in as your gmail.com account
* Click on the gear icon and then click Settings
* Click on "Import & Export" in the sidebar
* Click on "Select file from your computer"
   * The files extracted from the zip file, should contain one or more .ics files
   * choose a .ics file and click Import
* Repeat that process for each .ics file that you downloaded and extracted
