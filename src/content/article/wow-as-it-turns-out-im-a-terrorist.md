Pretty much spent my whole day trying to get subversion, ahnk, tortoisesvn and visual studio updated. I also began working on a new dialog to Adding Attachments that are not scanned. I&#8217;ve also decided that I need to create a user control that rolls up all the attachment functionality.

  Today Nathan got a call from our boss because apparantly he &#8220;freaked out&#8221; the cleaning crew. About a week ago or so he wrote at the top of our white board which covers a whole wall of our shared office, &#8220;Erik is a terrorist supercell&#8221;. A few people that came by saw it and chuckled so he took it a little further. This time he wrote &#8220;Erik is an Al Qaeda sympathiser and gave material support to Osama Bin Laden in the months immediately preceding the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City&#8221;. The boss kindly asked him to refrain from terrorism jokes. Its pretty funny I can just see the lady come into our office to empty the trash can and to throw my styrofoam cup away that I keep writing &#8220;PLEASE DONT THROW AWAY&#8221; on every night and then noticing the whiteboard and turning pale. I bet she gathered all the cleaning people in the building into our office as they all gasped. I&#8217;m just wondering if they really thought that possibly I&#8217;m a terrorist or if they just didn&#8217;t appreciate the joke and were offended. Pretty sure I&#8217;m going to write something in arabic script up there tonight just to freak them out. Wonder if I&#8217;ll get in trouble for that? Wouldn&#8217;t it be racist to consider that a terrorism joke? Hmm maybe I should leave well enough alone. My luck those people already turned me over to the CIA and I&#8217;ll get strip searched everytime I enter an airport for the rest of my life.
