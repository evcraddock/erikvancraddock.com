Mario and Andrea drove up to spend the weekend with us on friday night. They arrived at about 8 or 8:30. I guess Mario was already missing Sue who came to spend the remainder of linda&#8217;s prenancy on wednesday.

  On Saturday, I finally decided to do something about the door panel on the Durango. Linda has been asking me to get it fixed for months now. I went outside and removed the panel from the door hoping that I could find some way to fix the clips and put it back on where it would stay. Alas it was broken beyond repair with several of the plastic clips broken in half. Right then and there I knew that the only way to fix it was to replace it. So I jumped on Google and searched for some junkyards close by. I finally found one that said they had a durango with a side door panel. The place was called Square Deal.

  Drew, Mario and I jumped in the car after we secured Drew&#8217;s participation by promising him a root beer float. I loaded up the directions on my black berry and headed out. Mario seemed pretty impressed with the mobile map program that showed my location as we drove down the road. It really does come in handy. After we found Square Deal, I took a look at the durango and sure enough they had one except it was the WRONG door. The folks at Square Deal pointed me in the direction of another place down the street. This street was the junkyard mecca of Fort Worth. I swear there were like 50 junkyards all next to each other only seperated by large fences. Anyway got to the next place and they did have the correct door panel. It was exactly the same. They only accepted cash so I had to borrow the money from Mario as I never carry cash anymore. On the way home I called linda and tried to spin her a yarn about not being able to find the part. My plan was to install it in secret and let her be suprised when she noticed. HOWEVER, I was so worried about forgetting to pay Mario back the money he gave me that I told her not to let me forget to go to the bank for some cash. This prompted a &#8220;Why do you owe Dad money question?&#8221;. I&#8217;m an idiot, anyway I had to tell her then cause I wasn&#8217;t quick enough to come up with a lie that Mario would go along with.

  I spent pretty much the rest of the weekend playing games. I played the drums on Rockband with drew until I had a pretty sizeable blister on my finger. I felt like ringo starr or something. It was fun though and I&#8217;m getting pretty decent at it. I also spent a lot of time play wow. I managed to get Exalted with the Kaluak and got that epic fishing pole. I also did all the quests in Eastern Plaguelands and ran Stratholme and Scholomance until I got exalted with the Argent Crusade and got the Argent Champion title. I was pretty happy about it until I realized that pretty much everyone that I&#8217;ve been playing with has quit and there was no one to brag to. Pretty sure I&#8217;ve decided to take up a new hobby&#8230; not really sure what yet. Maybe contract killing.  Maybe I&#8217;ll be a drug dealer or some other nefarious act.  I&#8217;m sure pretty as soon as the baby gets here, I&#8217;ll wonder where I got all that free time.
